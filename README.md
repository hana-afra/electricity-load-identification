## Introduction

In this project, we aim to identify the different day types in the Algerian electricity load dataset. Understanding these day types can help in optimizing energy management strategies and making more informed decisions related to resource allocation.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of electricity load data collected over a specific period in Algeria. Each data point includes information about the electricity consumption at various times of the day. The dataset is instrumental in identifying patterns and anomalies that can be associated with different day types.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis. This step is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent analyses.

### Data Analysis

Data analysis involves examining the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies. Statistical techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are used to gain initial insights into the data.

### Visualization

Visualization techniques are employed to graphically represent the data, making it easier to identify patterns and trends. Various types of plots and charts are used to depict the electricity load across different days and times.

### Clustering Techniques

Clustering techniques are applied to group similar days based on their electricity load patterns. Techniques such as K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering are used to identify distinct day types within the dataset.

## Results

The results section presents the findings from the data analysis and clustering techniques. It includes the identified day types, their characteristics, and how they differ from each other in terms of electricity load patterns.

## Conclusion

The conclusion summarizes the key findings of the project, highlighting the identified day types and their implications for energy management in Algeria. It also discusses the limitations of the study and the reliability of the results.

## Future Work

Future work suggests potential areas for further research and improvement. It includes exploring additional datasets, refining clustering techniques, and developing predictive models for electricity load forecasting.
